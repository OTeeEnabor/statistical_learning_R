# Simple Linear Regression
The `ISLR2` library contains the `Boston` data set, which records medv (median house value) for 506 census tracts in Boston. We will seek to predict
`medv` using 12 predictors such as `rm` (average number of rooms per house), `age` (proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940) and `lstat` (per
cent of households with low socioeconomic status).
