This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ISLR)
data("College")
```
- Use the `pairs()` function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data.    

```{r}
pairs(College[, 1:10])
```
- Use the `plot()` function to produce side by side boxplots of `Outstate` vs `Private`.
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(4,4), mar=c(2,2,1,0))

for (i in 2:17)
  boxplot(College[, i] ~ College[, 1], xlab="", main=colnames(College)[i])
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
